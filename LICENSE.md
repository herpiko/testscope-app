## Additional Term – Non-Commercial SaaS Restriction

### Commercial SaaS Offering Prohibited

You may not provide, offer, or make available the Software, in whole or in part, as part of a commercial hosted service or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering, where customers, third parties, or the public can access or use the Software over a network, in exchange for payment or other commercial benefit, without prior written consent from the copyright holder.

### Allowed Internal Use

This restriction does not limit your right to run, modify, and deploy the Software internally for your own business purposes, including on-premises deployments for internal users.

### Clarification on "Commercial Benefit"

For purposes of this clause, “commercial benefit” includes charging a fee, receiving advertising revenue, or monetizing access in any way.

### Retaining AGPL Rights

All other terms of the AGPL-3.0 remain in full effect, including the requirement to make source code available to users who interact with the Software over a network.
