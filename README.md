# Testscope App

<img src="https://github.com/herpiko/testscope-app/blob/main/public/screenshot.png?raw=true">

Testscope started as a small piece of software I built to help my teammates test what we were buildingâ€”simple enough for anyone, even non-QA members, to use.

After four years, it went unmaintained, and I decided to fully abandon it due to the high running costs and the expense of the *.io domain. I assumed no one was still using it until the day it actually went offline, when people began reaching out. Unfortunately, the last database backup was from September 2024, and the VM was destroyed along with all the data.

I have since decided to open-source the code so anyone can self-host and manage it without relying on my service. I also plan to revive the service on a cheaper domain with a fair, sustainable subscription plan, so those without the capability to self-host can continue to use it.

This is my apology to those disappointed by the shutdown.

The code is a lot messy by my current standards, as I originally built it quickly solely to help my teammates. Especially the frontend, which is still somewhat tied to legacy libraries. However, I am open to any suggestions and contributions. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me at herpiko@gmail.com.
